feat(lissajous): implement animation

This commit implements the Lissajous curve animation using
`requestAnimationFrame` and double buffering. The animation loop is
handled in Go, and the drawing is done on an HTML canvas.

Gemini commit: yes. I want to use it as a way to familiarize myself with requestAnimationFrame and double buffering, can you do all that?
