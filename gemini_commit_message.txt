refactor(svg): move pattern creation to factory

This commit refactors the SVG pattern creation logic to improve
encapsulation. The `CreatePattern` method in `defs.go` now uses a
`NewPattern` factory function in `pattern.go` to create the `<pattern>`
element. This makes the `pattern.go` file solely responsible for the
lifecycle of `Pattern` objects.

Gemini commit: move the CreateElement call for the pattern out of defs.go, into a factory method in pattern.go.
