refactor(lissajous): use timestamp and draw a single cycle

This refactors the lissajous animation to be more efficient and robust.

- It now uses the `timestamp` from `requestAnimationFrame` to drive the
  animation, making it independent of the frame rate.
- It draws a single, complete cycle of the curve on each frame, rather
  than continuously extending the curve. The animation is achieved by
  varying the phase of the y-oscillator.

Gemini commit: it seems strange to draw from 0 to t when t grows unbounded. Shouldn't it only draw one circuit of the curve? Also, we're not using timestamp anywhere, wouldn't that be better to use than t, since it will make the animation run consistently even when frame rate goes down?
