refactor(animdemo): Optimize animation loop

This change refactors the animdemo animation loop to be more efficient.
Instead of recreating the SVG path elements on every frame, this change
creates them once and then updates their `d` attribute in the animation
loop. This avoids the overhead of creating and destroying DOM elements
on every tick, resulting in a smoother animation.

Gemini commit: let's change tracks. reload animdemo and take a look at the code. is there any way we can make the animation loop more efficient? We're rebuilding the entire path every time, which might have object creation/deletion costs, maybe we can get rid of that by just updating the coordinates of the existing paths?
