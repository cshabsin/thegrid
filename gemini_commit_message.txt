feat(svg): add pattern support

This commit adds support for SVG patterns, which are used to create
reusable, complex fills for shapes. This is useful for creating
textures like starfields or forests on a hex map.

The new API includes:

- A `<defs>` manager to ensure all patterns are stored in one place.
- A `CreatePattern` method to create new `<pattern>` elements.
- An `Append` method on the `Pattern` object to allow for composable
  patterns.

Gemini commit: Let's add a mechanism for adding pattern definitions to an SVG in js/svg's API, so we can make a sparse starfield or trees as a pattern for filling a hex in a hexgrid.
