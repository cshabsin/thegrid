feat(lissajous): implement adaptive resolution

This commit implements an adaptive resolution for the lissajous curve
drawing. The app now targets a smooth 60 FPS by automatically
adjusting the drawing resolution based on the observed frame rate. If
the animation slows down, the resolution is decreased to speed up
rendering. If the animation is running smoothly, the resolution is
increased to provide more detail.

Gemini commit: maybe we should automatically vary resolution based on observed frame rate - aim for 60 fps, so reduce resolution automatically when it gets too slow, increase it when it speeds up?
