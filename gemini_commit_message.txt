feat(canvas): add FullSize method

This adds a `FullSize` method to the `canvas.Canvas` type. This method resizes the canvas's drawing buffer to match its display size, which is a common requirement to avoid stretched or blurry graphics.

Gemini commit: what did you want FullSize to do? Should we add it to the canvas api?
