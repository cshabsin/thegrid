feat(lissajous): add interactive sliders

This commit adds sliders to the lissajous app, allowing the user to
interactively control the parameters of the curve, such as size,
frequency, and speed. This makes it easier to explore the different
patterns that can be generated.

Gemini commit: let's put in sliders for the different parameters defined at the top of the file - let the user vary them.
