fix(animdemo): Correct canvas scaling and size

This change addresses an issue where the canvas-based animation was
rendering at an excessively large size. The canvas resolution is now
set to a more reasonable 1000x1000, and CSS is used to scale the
canvas to fit the browser window while maintaining its aspect ratio.
The drawing context is also scaled to ensure the animation renders
correctly within the new resolution.

Gemini commit: relative size of the new canvas-based solution seems too big
